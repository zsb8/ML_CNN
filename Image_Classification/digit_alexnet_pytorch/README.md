## Custom CNN to recognize number

Download dataset MNIST.     
Run `download_dataset.py`
What is the MNIST?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database

Run `main_train_save_model.py` to train a modle, name best_model.pth in root folder.
Will run more time. 

The modle file `best_model.pth` is very big, about  144M , more the the file Github limit. 



Recognize a number, such as 3.       
Run `identify_number.py`
